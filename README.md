# Restful/JSON API Example

This is just a sample of an API being used in conjunction with LeafletJS.

## TODO:
1. Style popups
2. Create cases of data returns to make popups more clear to the average user without needing to translate. 
3. Create onclick event for each marker that pans and zooms to that marker.
